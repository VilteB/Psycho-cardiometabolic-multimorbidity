# Psycho-cardiometabolic-multimorbidity

This repository contains scripts that underlie the analysis in the paper: A Multivariate Genome-Wide Association Study of Psycho-Cardiometabolic Multimorbidity.    

- "GenomicSEM_GWAS_mulitmorbidity_NikMahaHoward-withUKBB.R" was used to perform the discovery analysis (using the largests input GWASs)
- "GenomicSEM_GWAS_mulitmorbidity_NikScotHoward_noUKBB.R" used input GWASs that did not contain the UK Biobank cohort, as it was used as our independent replication sample for polygenic risk score analysis
